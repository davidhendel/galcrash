Usage

A Juypter notebook designed to simulate and display simple galaxy mergers and other interesting concepts in galactic dynamics.

The primary goal is to abstract as much as possible so that no progamming experience is required, making it suitable for Astro 101 demos or outreach activities. 

This work is inspired by the now-defunct GalCrash Java web applet built by Chris Mihos' Dynamical Astronomy JavaLab http://burro.case.edu/JavaLab/
